## Setup
###Prerequisites 
Following are some of the prerequsits for the development environment

1. Google Account
1. Google App Engine SDK for python
1. Python 2.7+ 

###Local Application Setup

1. Update the value of `application` in `app.yaml` to the app ID you
   have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host
   your instance.  I have already updated this with my application id
1. Update the values at the top of `settings.py` to
   reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
   [Developer Console][4]. The `settins.py` has been updated with my id
1. Update the value of CLIENT_ID in `static/js/app.js` to the Web client ID
1. Run the app with the devserver using `dev_appserver.py DIR`, and ensure it's running by visiting
   your local server's address (by default [localhost:8080][5].). or the port that you configured your app to run on.

###Application Details

1. Application Name 
	`sams-conference-app`
1. WEB_CLIENT_ID 
	`453719718803-kpltcg8jlmo351vs7vmrch8gm2caf5g2.apps.googleusercontent.com`
1. URL [Sams Conference App][APPURL]

## Assumptions

1. The start date and end date validation take in to account time till 23:59
1. Only the organizers can update edit and create sessions for the conference.
1. The front end application is updated but does not use all the endpoints created through the project
1. One session can have only one session.
1. Necessary modifications can be made to the provided UI
1. UI updates are optional and not all features need to be implemented in the UI
1. Test cases need not be prepared for the Web and API.

## Extra Credit Features

1. **Separate Entity for Speakers:** A separate entity has been created for the speakers
1. **Design Choice :** Design Choice included in the readme.
1. **UI Changes:** All the new features added to the api have also been added to the UI of the application.
1. **Email Confirmations:** Various confirmation mails have been added to the  application.

## Explanations

### Speaker Implementation

* **Task 1 Design Choices**

The diagram below shows the different entities and their symbolic relationship.

![alt text][dbdesign]


**Speakers**
Following are some of the reason why I created a separate Speaker entity

 * A separate entity for Speakers for capturing a more information about them.
 * Separate entity allows to show user the differnt speakers at the time of session creation.
 * Asumed that a session can have only one speaker.
 * Separate entity allows me to search the session using the speaker keys.
 * Any registered user can be registered as a speaker.
 * Keeping only the speaker specific detail in this entity other information is picked from the user profile.
 * This also helps me to send the speaker data only what is required. 
 * This approach allowed me to add a whole new section in the UI for showing / filtering session by speaker
 * There is no cleanup code for this phase of the project. meaning there is no code to cleanup the old conferences and sessions whose end date has been reached.
 * When a conference is updated the start date has to be changed to min current date.


**How Speakers Are Linked Sessions**
 * When a new session is created one of the Speaker key is sent as part of the request. 
 * The speaker key is saved in the speaker field of the entity. The indexes have been updated to allow easy query of the data.
 * The session is a child of the Conference. 
 * This makes it easy to search sesssions for a conference.

### Additional Queries

* **Task 3 Additional Queries**

* **Query 1 Sessions Starting Soon**
 A new query has been added to fetch 5 of the sessions starting at a configurable interval. The query is implemented in the API and appliction. This will allow the users to know what sessions are starting say in next 30 minutes. This query allows the user to select the sessions for date and time.
 	* To make this work I have added the start_time to the start_date befoe storing the information in the datastore


 * **API implimentaion**  a new method 'getSessionsStartingSoon' has been added to to the api where the user can pass in the start date and the time interval. The system fetches the sessions if any within the specified time interval.

 * **MEMCACHE implimentaion**  a new cron task has been added to fire the similar query to fetch sessions if any within the specified time interval that are about start soon and add them to the memcache using the method `_cache_starting_soon`. The web application has been updated to get this information out of memcache using the `getSessionsStartingSoonCached` method and show the same in the Crrousel on the home page.

* **Query 3 Sessions Within Date Range**
 A new query has been added to fetch all the sesssion in decending order of date and time within a specified start-date and end-date. The query is implemented in the API and appliction. 
 * The UI uses this query and allows the user to easly filter the sessions for today , this week, this month, and this year.

 `getAllFutureSessions` method is flexible enough that it will work only if start date is provided. In this case it will fetch the sessions form the passed start-date

* **Query 2 Sessions by speaker name**
 A new query has been added to the API to find the sessions for a speaker by speaker name. This will be really useful to searh the session if the user only knows the speaker name. The is not emplement in the ewb application yet.

 `getSessionsBySpeaker()`  method works both for speaker keys and speaker name


### Query Problem

* **Task 3 Query Problem**

**Problem:** Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm? What is the problem for implementing this query? What ways to solve it did you think of?

**Reason of the Problem**
Acording to the ndb [doccumentation][7] the datastore enforces some restrictions on queries

"Limitations: The Datastore enforces some restrictions on queries. Violating these will cause it to raise exceptions. For example, **combining too many filters, using inequalities for multiple properties, or combining an inequality with a sort order on a different property are all currently disallowed. Also filters referencing multiple properties sometimes require secondary indexes to be configured.** "

**Proposed and Implemented Soultion:** After going through multiple documents and web forums I implemented the following solution.

	* Query the sessions before the specified time 7PM(19:00) in this case and store it a variable timeQry. remember to fetch only the keys.

	* Query the sessions which are not of the specified type  "WORKSHOP" in this case and store it a variable typeQry. remember to fetch only the keys.

	* Create a set by intersection the queries `set(timeQry).intersection(typeQry)` 

	* Use `ndb.get_multi(set(timeQry).intersection(typeQry))` fetch all the intersected sessions

	
The API method `getAllSessionsBeforeTime` allows the user to pass in any datetime and type of session to apply the above logicand return relevant sessions.


I choose this approach because

* This required minimum change in the application.
* Since this is a class project I do not foresee a large increase in the data

**Disadvantages of this approach**  

* As the amount of data increases this approach might not be a good solution as we will be working on large data sets
* The performance of the app might go down in case there is a large increase in the data.
